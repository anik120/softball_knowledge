The third baseman is the position on the right side of the diamond when you are facing home plate. They are
responsible for fielding all balls hit their way including bunts. In
fact, the third baseman fields more bunts than a pitcher and first
baseman do. Third base is also called the "Hot Corner" because the ball
can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast. Third baseman must have
great reflexes and be very quick on their feet because not only to they
need to be quick to field a bunt but also if they are unable to predict
whether the batter will bunt or hit, a ball that is hit may be a line
drive to the face. It also helps if they can run fast but it is not a
requirement. A third baseman must have a very strong arm so that they
can throw a runner out from across the diamond. Any ball that the third
baseman can get, they should. They will have more momentum towards first
base when fielding the ball than a shortstop. They are also closer to
first base when they cut off a slower ground ball towards shortstop.
Third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times
unless the ball is hit to them. In that instance, the shortstop is
responsible for third base. Third baseman must be smart, have great
reflexes, have a strong accurate arm, and be quick with their hands.
