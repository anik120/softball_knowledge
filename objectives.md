A softball game Fastpitch softball is played between two teams on a large field, 
with nine players (in 10u and above; 8u and below is usually played with ten players on a
field at once) from one team on the field at a time. Slow-pitch softball
is played with ten fielders but can be played with nine if needed.

The softball field is usually composed of a dirt or brick dust
infield that contains the shape and running areas
of a diamond and a grass outfield. However, the
field can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial
turf or asphalt. There are four bases on the
infield: First base, second
base, third base, and
home plate. The bases are arranged in a square
and are typically apart. Near the center of this square is the
pitcher's circle, and within the circle is the
"rubber", a small flat rectangular plate a foot and a half in length.
The rubber distance from the plate in fastpitch can be as short as 35
feet for 10u players up to 43 feet for ages 14 and older. In slow
pitch softball, the rubber distance can be 43, 46 or 50 feet depending
on age level and the league one is playing in.

The object of the game is to score more runs
(points) than the other team by batting
(hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching each
one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with
leather or synthetic material. It is (or, rarely) in
circumference. The game is officiated by one or more neutral
umpires. Players and umpires are generally free to
ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play
(called a time out), or immediately following a play once its outcome is
clear.

The game is played in usually seven innings. Each
inning is divided into a top half, in
which the away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team
occupies the field and tries to record three
outs; then a bottom
half, when the teams' roles are reversed.
Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit,
rather than the traditional seven innings.
