Despite the fact that it was originally intended to be played indoors,
softball is usually played outdoors. The indoor form is sometimes called
Arena Softball. Indoor softball has
generally the same rules as outdoor softball. Only the wall behind the
batter is considered foul territory. The other walls are considered
fair. Usually, there is a small area on one of the walls in the outfield
that results in a home run being awarded if the batted ball hits it.
Pitching is generally a little slower because of the indoor turf, or
pitched through a pitching machine at younger levels. There is no limit
to the number of batters a team may have available, although only so
many can bat in one inning. Some indoor facilities do not allow the use
of metal cleats on the field, which are what players at the age of 14
and up generally use. Also, some tournaments may require a time limit
for games. [INDOOR SOFTBALL
