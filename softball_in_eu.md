Softball is played in almost every country in Europe, mainly fastpitch.
Every two years an open women's European fastpitch championship is held with over
twenty nationals teams. Italy and Netherlands are the best nations, and
both have an almost professional championship where athletes from the
US, Australia and China play. In the men's division eight to ten
national teams compete for the European championship, with the Czech
Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark leading the way.
