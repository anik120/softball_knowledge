There are nine players out on the field at one time in fastpitch
softball and 10 players in slow-pitch softball. Although the pitcher and
catcher have the ball the most, each person has a specific job. In the
infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman,
shortstop, and third baseman. In the outfield there is a left fielder,
center fielder, and right fielder. In slow-pitch softball there is an
extra outfielder in the outfield, who is specified as a roamer or rover.
Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning
there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and
right fielder. The recent trend with tournament and league slow pitch
softball play is to field five infielders instead of four outfielders.
The extra infielder is commonly placed behind the pitcher on either side
of second base.
