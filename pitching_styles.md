Pitching in softball involves various
styles. The International Softball
Federation(ISF) recognizes three pitching styles:

-   fastpitch
-   "modified" fastpitch
-   slowpitch

#### Fastpitch style

The pitching distance can range between 35 feet for younger players and
43 feet for older players. Collegiate and international level pitchers
pitch from 43 feet. Pitches can travel at speeds of 85 mph (137 km/h) .


The pitcher begins with her arm at the hip. Then she brings the ball
in a circular motion over the head, completes the circle back down at
the hip, and snaps the hand.

The ball is not brought over the head at all but down and behind the
body and back in one smooth motion tracing out a figure eight.

Illegal forms of pitching*
-   "crow-hopping"
-   "leaping"

#### "Modified" fastpitch style

-   *"Modified" windmill*


- A "modified" fastpitch is identical to a "windmill" pitch except the
arm is not brought over the head in a full windmill motion, but instead
is brought behind the body (restricted back swing) and is then thrust
directly forward for the release.

#### Slowpitch style

The pitching distance is 50 feet. The pitch must be lofted in such a way
that it falls onto the plate in order for it to be a called strike (the
ball falls into the strike-zone instead of flying through). Strikeouts
are rare in slowpitch. Pitchers strategize to pitch the ball with a high
enough arc that the batter cannot hit a line-drive. The speed of the
pitches ranges from , resulting in plenty of reaction time.

-   *half windmill*


- High-arc pitching technique

- The pitch must be thrown with an arc between 6-12 feet high. If the
arc is not high enough, the umpire will call the pitch illegal.

### Types of pitches

#### Fastballs

The fastball is typically the first type of pitch a player will learn.

-   Two-seam fastball
-   Four-seam fastball

#### Breaking balls

-   Dropball
-   Riseball
-   Curveball
-   Screwball
-   Drop-curve
-   Rise-curve
-   Backdoor curve (the pitch starts out of the strike zone and curves
    back over the plate. Often, this pitch is thrown at a batters hip or
    hands with the intention of either moving them off the plate or
    inducing a foul ball)
-   Drop screw
-   Backdoor screw (the same as a backdoor curve except the ball spins
    in the opposite direction of a curveball)
-   Drop curve

#### Changeups

The changeup is the staple off-speed
pitch, usually thrown to look like a
fastball but arriving much slower to the plate. Its reduced speed
coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter's
timing. There are a variety of grips and techniques a pitcher may use to
deliver a change up such as:

-   Flip (or "Back-hand flip") release
-   Stiff wrist release
-   Circle grip changeup
-   Knuckle grip changeup

##### Other off-speed pitches

-   Knuckleball
-   Knuckle curveball
-   Floater


- This is a pitch used by pitchers in the slow-pitch game. To throw the
floater accurately, pitcher holds the ball with just his or her
fingertips and does not let them touch the laces. Then comes straight up
with her hand and lets the ball go up to the 12-foot mark and come down.
