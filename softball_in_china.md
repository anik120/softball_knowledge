Since the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics, the Chinese have now made
softball a priority at all levels. The game is played in most
schools and with a 1.3 billion population; the number of great players
is turning out to be a boon for China. The Chinese have frequently
toured the US and have now similar caliber coaching and training programs.
