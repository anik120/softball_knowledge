The pitcher is the individual who throws the ball
from the middle of the diamond. As in baseball, fastpitch softball has a
rubber used to control the pitchers delivery. A pitcher must have both
feet on the rubber at the start of their delivery but neither foot is on
the rubber when the ball is released. In baseball, the rubber is on a
mound of dirt as gravity is used to generate speed. In softball, the
pitchers throw from within a circle and the rubber in the circle is not
elevated. The circle is also used to control base runners. When the
pitcher is in possession of the ball in the circle, a runner who has
passed a base must either advance or return to the base. They cannot
"bait" the pitcher to throw or they will be called out. The pitcher
tries to throw the ball in the strike zone. In
order to do that, they start while having the ball in their glove, they
throw their arms behind their hips, they shoot forwards with their leg,
which is on the same side as their glove, and leave their glove hand
there and the other arm goes around the shoulder, bends the elbow, and
turns their wrist toward the third baseman, and brings their arm through
at the end, flicks their wrist, (which affects the ball's speed, spin
and subsequent motion), and brings the arm up, with the hand by their
shoulder. They follow through with their legs turning their pitching
stance into a fielding stance. They try to release the ball when they go
past their hips. In softball, the pitcher uses an underarm motion to
pitch the ball towards the strike zone. As soon as the pitcher makes a
throw, the fielders are ready to field balls that are hit in the middle
of the diamond. Pitchers usually tend to be tall, very flexible and
have good upper body strength. Pitchers can be righthanded or
lefthanded. The softball pitcher makes a windmill motion while throwing
underhand, unlike baseball pitchers who throw overhand.
