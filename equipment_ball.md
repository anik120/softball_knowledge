Despite the sport's name, the ball is not actually soft, though it does have a
lower density and greater coefficient of restitution than a baseball.

The size of the ball varies according to the variety played and age of
the participants. The circumference for fastpitch for adults is (), with
a mass between , while children under 12 use a ball with a circumference
of () with a mass between . A 12-inch circumference ball is generally
used in slow pitch. (For comparison, a baseball is in circumference and
has a mass between.)

The ball is covered in two pieces of leather or similar synthetic
covering that are roughly the shape of a figure-8 and sewn together
along a continuous seam. The core of the ball may be made of long fiber
kapok, a mixture of cork and rubber, a polyurethane mixture, or another 
approved material.

Before 1993, white balls were standard at all levels of play. In that
year, a new, fluorescent optic yellow colored ball was first used in
college softball. Yellow softballs have become the standard for all
levels of play; white balls are also still allowed, but are very
uncommon today.

In Chicago, where softball was invented, it
remains traditional to play a variant of slow-pitch with a ball in
circumference. The fielders do not wear
gloves or mitts. A 16-inch softball when new is rough and hard, with
hand and finger injuries to fielders frequent if they do not "give" when
receiving a ball, but the ball "breaks in" slightly during a game
and continues to soften over time with continued play. A well-broken-in
ball is called a mush ball and is favored for informal "pick-up" games
and when playing in limited space, such as a city street (because the
ball does not go as far). A 16-inch ball is also used for wheelchair
softball.
