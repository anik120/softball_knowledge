Decisions about plays are made by umpires. The
number of umpires on a given game can range from a minimum of one to a
maximum of seven. There is never more than one "plate umpire"; there can
be up to three "base umpires", and up to a further three umpires
positioned in the outfield. Most fastpitch games use a crew of two
umpires (one plate umpire, one base umpire).

Official umpires are often nicknamed "blue", because of their uniforms –
in many jurisdictions, most significantly ISF, NCAA and ASA games,
umpires wear navy blue slacks, a light powder blue shirt, and a navy
baseball cap. Some umpires wear a variant of the uniform: some umpires
in ASA wear heather gray slacks and may also wear a navy blue shirt;
umpires from the USSSA wear red shirts with grey slacks; National Softball
Association (NSA) umpires wear an official NSA white-colored umpire shirt with 
black pants or black shorts; NSA fastpitch umpires wear the white NSA umpires shirt 
and heather gray slacks.

Decisions are usually indicated by both the use of hand signals, and by
vocalizing the call. Safe calls are made by signaling with flat hands
facing down moving away from each other, and a verbal call of "safe".
Out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist, with a
verbal call of "out". Strikes are called by the plate umpire, who uses
the same motion as the out call with a verbal call of "strike". Balls
are only called verbally, with no hand gesture. The umpire also has the
option of not saying anything on a ball. It is understood that when he
stands up, the pitch was not a strike. Foul balls are called by extending 
both arms up in the air with a verbal call of "foul ball", while fair balls 
are indicated only by pointing towards fair territory with no verbal call. 
No signal is given for balls that are obviously foul; for closer calls that are
not borderline a signal is given.

All decisions made by the umpire(s) are considered to be final. Only
decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to
be protestable. At some tournaments there might be a rules interpreter
or Tournament Chief Umpire (TCU) (also known as the Umpire In Chief, or
UIC) available to pass judgment on such protests, but it is usually up
to the league or association involved to decide if the protest would be
upheld. Protests are never allowed on what are considered "judgment
calls" – balls, strikes, and fouls.
