The field is defined by *foul lines* that meet at a right angle at *home
plate*. The minimum length of the baselines varies classification of
play. A fence running between the baselines defines the limits of the field; 
distance from home plate to the fence varies by field. The widest part of the 
field is the distance between the *foul poles*, which are erected where the foul lines meet
the fence, and are about apart depending on the length of the foul lines.

Home plate is one corner of a diamond with *bases* at each corner. The
bases are cushions square, of canvas or a similar material, and not more
than thick. The bases are usually securely fastened to the ground. The
bases are numbered counter clockwise as first base, second base, and
third base. Often, but not always, outside first base (that is, in foul
territory) and adjacent and connected to it, there is a contrast-colored
"double base" or "safety base" intended to prevent collisions between
the first baseman and the runner. The runner runs for the foul portion
of the double base after hitting the ball while the fielding team tries
to throw the ball to the fair portion before the runner reaches the
safety base. However, not all softball diamonds have these safety bases
and they are much more common in women's softball than in men's. The
double base is required in the U-18 Women's Softball World
Cup.

The infield consists of the diamond and the adjacent space in which the
infielders normally play. The outfield is the remaining
space between the baselines and between the outfield fence and the
infield. The infield is usually "skinned" (dirt), while the outfield has
grass in regulation competitions.

Near the center of the diamond is the pitching plate, or colloquially
"rubber". In fastpitch, a circle in diameter known as the *pitching
circle* is market around the pitching plate.

A field is officially required to have a warning track between from the
outfield fence. However, if the game is being played on a field larger
than required, no warning track is required before the temporary
outfield fencing.

Located in foul territory outside both baselines are two coach's boxes.
Each box is behind a line long located from each baseline.
