A softball game can last anywhere from 3 to 7 *innings*, or 1â€“2 hours
depending on the league, rules, and type of softball. The teams take
turns batting. Officially, which team bats first is decided by a coin
toss, although a league may decide otherwise at its discretion. The
most common rule is that the home team bats second. Batting second is
also called "last at-bat". Many softball players prefer to bat second
because they feel they have more control in the last inning, since they
have the last at-bat.

In the event of a tie, extra innings are usually played until the tie is
broken except in certain tournaments and championships. If the home team
is leading and the road team has just finished its half of the seventh
inning, the game ends because it is not necessary for the home team to
bat again. In all forms of softball, the defensive team is the *fielding
team*; the offensive team is *at bat* or *batting* and is trying to
score runs.
