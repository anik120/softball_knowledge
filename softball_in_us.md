In America, there are more than 1,500 college softball teams spanning
five different levels: NCAA Division 1, Division 2, Division 3,
NAIA, and NJCAA. There are 5 professional softball teams: the Aussie
Peppers, the Chicago Bandits, the Cleveland Comets, the California
Commotion, and the Canadian Wild.

Competitive fastpitch softball for girls is growing increasingly popular. 
All over the US, there are thousands of teams that compete year-round at tournaments. 
During most of these tournaments the biggest goal is not winning the tournament, but
attempting to get as many college coaches as possible to observe a
particular player or players. Competitive teams are now beginning around
eight years old, if not younger. Depending on the team they can travel
all over the United States or even out of the country such as to Canada,
the summer and fall for many weeks and days at a time.

There are many different sanctioning bodies of softball:
USSSA, ASA, ISA, NSA, WSL, USFA, Triple Crown and
SASL just to name a few. One of the biggest is the Amateur Softball
Association(ASA). It is known as the national governing body of softball, 
was established in 1933 and has over 240,000 teams. The USSSA, founded in 
1968 as the United States Slo-Pitch Softball Association, but renamed in 1997 
to the United States Specialty Sports Association, is the only association that still has a
men's major slow-pitch program alive. Currently, the USSSA program is
run out of Viera, FL. The United States also has a competitive women's
softball team that competes in international tournaments. They
represented the US each time at the Olympics until softball was removed
from the Olympics.

The Amateur Softball Association of America (founded 1933) is one of the
largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors
annual sectional and World Series championships. Other national and
regional governing bodies also exist, including the USSSA. The World
Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, 
including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the
International Softball Federation (ISF) filled this role.

The USA Softball Men's Fast Pitch National Team has won five World
Championships (1966, 1968, 1976, 1980 and 1988) and three other medals.
In the Pan-American Games, Team USA has made the finals in all seven
appearances at the Games when Men's Fast Pitch was played.
