Japan has had a long tradition of softball which is played at all levels
in the country. Many high schools and colleges have sports programs
which include softball. Like baseball, softball in Japan is intensely
competitive. Japan's win over the United States at the 2008
Olympics reflects the advanced level of play in this East Asian country.
