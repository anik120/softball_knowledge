The catcher is normally behind home plate in a
squatted position (some plays may
require the catcher to stand at an angle for intentional walks). At the
plate the catcher is responsible for catching pitches, keeping
mispitched balls in front of the plate, calling pitches that are
normally done through hand signals, picking off runners, and they are
considered the leaders of the field. Catchers must know how many outs
there are, the number of strikes and balls on the batter so they can
relay that to their teammates. They must also know how many runners are
on base and where the ball should be thrown next in the following play.
Catchers are strong, need to be smart and quick on their feet, and have
accurate throws so they can pick runners off at each base. Catchers
should be able to have strong and muscular legs to squat for a long
period of time. The gear worn by a catcher protects them from balls
thrown in the dirt or wild pitches. The catcher is allowed to take off
his/her mask to catch a pop fly or to watch the play.
