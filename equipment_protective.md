Catcher wearing a helmet and chest protector.
Helmets must be worn by batters and runners. A helmet must have two ear
flaps, one on each side. Helmets and cages that are damaged or altered
are forbidden. In NCAA fastpitch softball, players have the option to
wear a helmet with or without a face mask. Most female travel ball teams
for fastpitch softball require the batter to wear a helmet with a face
mask. In male fastpitch masks are generally only used for medical
reasons.

In fastpitch, the catcher must wear a protective helmet with a face-mask
and throat protector, shin guards and body protector. Shin guards also
protect the kneecap. In slow pitch, the catcher must wear a helmet,
chest protector and mask at youth levels. At adult levels, there is no
formal requirement for the catcher to wear a mask, although the official
rules recommend it. A catcher may optionally wear a body protector in
adult slow pitch.

While mandatory for the pitcher in some slow pitch leagues, there is an
option to wear a face mask on the field. It is recommended in lower age
groups. It must be in proper condition and not damaged, altered, or the
like. This is intended to prevent facial injuries.
