Play often, but not always, begins with the umpire saying "play ball".
After the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in
fair territory at their respective positions, the pitcher stands at the
pitching plate and attempts to throw the ball past the batter to the
catcher behind home plate. The throw, or pitch, must be made with an
underhand motion.

The pitcher throws the ball in or around the "strike zone". However, in
advanced play pitcher and catcher play a psychological game trying to
get the batter to guess where the next pitch is going and if it will be
a strike. In other instances, such as when an extremely powerful hitter
comes up to bat and they are followed by a weaker hitter, a pitcher may
deliberately walk the first batter based on the calculation that the
next batter will be an easy out. The strike zone is slightly different
in different forms of softball. A pitch that passes through that zone is
a "strike". A pitch at which the batter swings is also a strike, as is
any hit ball that lands in foul territory that is not caught out.

A pitch that is not a strike and at which the batter does not swing is
known as a "ball". The number of balls and strikes is called the
"count". The number of balls is always given first, as 2 and 1, 2 and 2,
and so on. A count of 3 and 2 is a "full count" since the next ball or
strike will end the batter's turn at the plate unless the ball goes
foul.

Unlike in baseball, softball pitches are thrown in an underhand
style. In softball, a pitch is the act of throwing a
softball toward home plate to start a play. All
pitches are thrown from below the waist in an underhand motion. The
phases of throwing include the grip, stance, windup, stride, release and
follow through.

Pitchers throw a variety of pitches, each of which
has a slightly different velocity, trajectory, movement, hand position,
wrist position and/or arm angle. These variations are introduced to
confuse the batter in various ways, and ultimately aid the defensive
team in getting the batter or baserunners out. To obtain variety, and
therefore enhance defensive baseball strategy, the pitcher manipulates
the grip on the ball at the point of release.
Variations in the grip cause the seams to "catch" the air differently,
thereby changing the trajectory of the ball, making it harder for the
batter to hit.

The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of
factors including the type of hitter who is being faced; whether there
are any base runners; how many outs have been made in the inning; and
the current score.

### Signaling

The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch is traditionally made
by the catcher by relaying hand signals to the
pitcher with the fingers. In more advanced play, coaches may give signs
to batters and/or runners to initiate special plays in certain
situations. A catcher may signal to a position player that they will be
trying to throw the runner out. A runner on base may see the pitch sign
given by the catcher and hint it to the batter using hand or body
motions.
