In most versions of slow pitch (including 16-inch) the pitch is lobbed
so that the ball rises above the batter's head and lands on a small
rectangular area on the ground behind the plate called "the well".
Umpires will make calls based on where the ball lands behind the plate;
a pitch landing in the well is a strike. These restrictions make it much
easier to put the ball into play and extremely difficult to use pitching
as a defensive strategy, as the physics of projectile
motion limit how fast a ball can be
thrown under such conditions and still be called a strike. In other
varieties of slow pitch (sometimes known as "modified"), the only
restriction is that the windmill cannot be used; thus the pitching arm
cannot be raised above the shoulder and both the wind-up and the release
must be underhand, still allowing for moderate speed and control in
pitching.
