## Recreational play

It is estimated that 14.62 million Americans played at least one game of
softball during the spring of 2015. It is played by men and women
both recreationally and competitively.

Softball is especially popular as a recreational activity for adults.
Leagues for such play are often characterized as either "fun leagues",
in which the outdoor exercise and player camaraderie is more important
than the final result, or "serious leagues". The distinction is not
absolute and there can be gradations within each. Softball teams are
often organized around groups of employees who play in the early evening
after work in the summer. In many US cities, adult softball teams are
organized by bars and clubs, hence the popular term "beer
league" softball. The teams can be men's,
women's or co-ed, and skill levels can range from novice to elite, with
league composition reflecting that. These leagues are typically either
slow-pitch or modified.

Co-ed recreational leagues, where men and women play on the same team,
generally have provisions to keep men from dominating the game. League
rules may stipulate that there must be an equal number of men and women
on the team, or that batting order alternate male and female
batters. Some leagues only require three women to play but they must
be present on the field at all times. Others will allow a game to
proceed when a team does not have the requisite number of women
available but charge the batting team with an automatic out whenever the
missing woman's place in the batting order comes up.
