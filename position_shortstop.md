The shortstop fields all balls hit to the
infield between the second and third bases. This individual also helps
cover second and third bases, is frequently involved in force
plays and double plays, and often throws the ball to the catcher
to throw out runners at home plate. On steals to second base (when the
runner from first is advancing to second on the pitch) the shortstop
usually covers. The shortstop does not cover second base only when a
right-handed batter is up. In this case, the second baseman covers the
steal. Most shortstops are very quick, agile and think fast. Shortstops
may play in a restricted zone but are faced with many types of hits and
interact closely with the second base, third base and home plate. Often
double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the shortstop. When a
ball is hit up the middle and the shortstop catches it, they will flip
the ball to the second baseman for the best result. Shortstop also takes
the cut off for the left field when the play is at second base. When the
ball is hit to the right side of the outfield, the shortstop then covers
second base. If there is a runner on first base and there is a hit down
the line or in the gap to right field, the shortstop will then go for
the cut to third. Meaning the runner that is going from first to second
will most likely be advancing to third, and in that case, the shortstop
will be the cut off for the throw from right field to third base.
Shortstop can be one of the most difficult positions to play due to the
number of balls being hit in that direction.
