To start play, the offense sends a batter to home plate. The batting
order must be fixed at the start of the game, and players may not bat 
out of turn. The defense's pitcher stands atop the rubber and
pitches the ball towards home plate using an underhand motion. 
In fast pitch, the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to releasing 
the ball during the forward movement. The batter attempts to hit the pitched ball 
with a bat, a long, round, smooth stick made of wood, metal or composite. If the 
pitcher throws three strikes against a batter, then the batter is out and the next 
batter in the order comes up to bat. A strike is recorded any time a batter swings 
at and misses a pitch or when a batter hits a ball foul (out of play). A strike
is also recorded any time the batter does not swing at a pitch that crosses home plate 
within an area known as the strike zone. In fast pitch, to be within the strike zone, 
the pitch must cross over home plate, and as it crosses it must be above the knees and 
slightly below the shoulders (roughly the armpit or the shirt logo). The strike zone
therefore varies from batter to batter. In slow pitch, the ball must land on a carpet 
or marked area behind the plate, therefore standardizing the strike zone. A pitch outside 
the strike zone is a ball. If the batter reaches four balls, the batter is awarded the 
first base in what is known as a "walk". The umpire behind home plate is the sole arbiter 
of balls and strikes. A foul ball may or may not result in a strikeout dependent upon
what association and local league rules. However, bunting a foul ball does result in a
strikeout. In some associations and leagues, bunting is not allowed and results in an out. 
Also, if a player has two strikes, swinging and partially hitting the ball can result in an 
out if the catcher manages to catch the tipped ball.

Offensive strategy is mostly just to hit the ball skillfully to let the
batter reach base and advance other runners around the bases to score
runs. The count of balls and strikes indicates how aggressive the batter
should be. The offense may try to sacrifice, with the batter deliberately 
making an out in order to advance runners. Defensive strategy is more complex, 
as particular situations (number of outs and positions of base-runners) and 
particular batters call for different positioning of fielders and different tactical decisions. 
The defense may decide to allow a run if it can achieve one or multiple outs.
