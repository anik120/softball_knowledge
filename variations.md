Sixteen-inch softball, also sometimes referred to as "mush ball" or "super-slow pitch" 
(although the ball is not soft at all), is a direct descendant of Hancock's original game.
Defensive players are not allowed to wear fielding gloves. Sixteen-inch
softball is played extensively in Chicago, where devotees such as
newspaper columnist Mike Royko consider it the "real" game, and New Orleans. 
In New Orleans, sixteen-inch softball is called "Cabbage Ball" or "batter ball" 
and is a popular team sport in area elementary and high schools.

The first cork-centered softball was created in Hamilton,
Ontario, Canada, by Emil "Pops" Kenesky.

By the 1940s, fast pitch began to dominate the game. Although slow pitch
was present at the 1933 World's Fair, the main course of action taken was to 
lengthen the pitching distance. Slow pitch achieved formal recognition in 1953 
when it was added to the program of the Amateur Softball Association, and within a
decade had surpassed fast pitch in popularity.

1953 was the year that the first women's softball league was established in the United Kingdom.
That was the start of the British women's softball league in the year 1953.

The National Softball Hall of Fame and
Museum was opened in Oklahoma City, United States, in 1957.

In 1991, women's fast pitch softball was selected to debut at the 1996
Summer Olympics. The 1996 Olympics also marked a key era in the introduction of 
technology in softball. The IOC funded a landmark bio-mechanical study on pitching 
during the games.

In 2002, sixteen-inch slow pitch was written out of the International
Softball Federation(ISF) official rules, although it is still played extensively in the United
States under The Amateur Softball Association of America, or ASA rules.

The 117th meeting of the International Olympic Committee, held in
Singapore in July 2005, voted to drop softball and baseball as Olympic sports for the 
2012 Summer Olympics. They were reinstated for the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021.

Other sanctioning bodies of softball are AAU, NSA, PONY, Babe Ruth
League, ASA, ISC, USSSA and Triple Crown.
