A "run" is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order,
proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the
same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and
attempt to advance on a later play.

A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the
same play that the runner crosses home plate. For instance, if a runner
is on third base prior to a hit, and he or she crosses home plate after
an out is made, either on the batter or another runner, the run is not
counted.
