The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago, Illinois, on
thanksgiving Day, 1887. It took place at the Farragut Boat Club at a 
gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University and Harvard University 
football game. When the score was announced and bets were settled, 
a Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan 
grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled up glove.George Hancock, a reporter there, 
called out "Play ball!" and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened
into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended
with a score of 41â€“40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded.

Hancock is credited as the game's inventor for his development of a 17"
ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set
rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a
way for baseball players to maintain their skills
during the winter, the sport was called "Indoor Baseball". Under the
name of "Indoor-Outdoor", the game moved outside in the next year, and
the first rules were published in 1889.

In 1895 Lewis Rober, Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise 
for firefighters; this game was known as kitten ball (after the first team 
to play it), lemon ball, or diamond ball. Rober's version of the game used 
a ball 12 inches (30 cm) in circumference, rather than the ball used by the Farragut club, and
eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed, although the dimensions of
the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of
the Chicago one. Rober may not have been familiar with the Farragut Club
rules. Fire Station No. 19 in Minneapolis, Rober's post from 1896 to 1906, 
was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its
association with the sport's development. The first softball league
outside the United States was organized in Toronto,
Ontario, in 1897.

The name "softball" dates back to 1926. The name was coined by Walter
Hakanson of the YMCA at a meeting of the National Recreation Congress. 
In addition to "indoor baseball", "kitten ball", and "diamond ball", 
names for the game included "mush ball", and "pumpkin ball". 
The name softball had spread across the United States by 1930. 

By the 1930s, similar sports with different rules and names were being played 
all over the United States and Canada. A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair 
spurred interest in the game. By 1936, the Joint Rules Committee on
Softball had standardized the rules and naming throughout the United States.
