All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or similar
material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger, known as
the "pocket". Gloves used in softball are typically larger than the
ones used in baseball to account for the larger ball. No glove larger
than can be used in ASA (American Softball Association) sanctioned play.

While extremely rare in recreational play, there are sometimes different
size gloves for different positions on the field. Catchers and first
baseman have what is called a mitt, whose pockets are larger than other
gloves. These are more padded. An outfielder's glove is smaller than
the catcher's, typically 12 inches to 13 inches for fast pitch softball
or 12 to 15 inches for slow pitch. An infielder's glove is the
smallest, typically from 11.5 inches to 13 inches. A pitcher's glove
is typically 11.5 to 12.5 inches for fast pitch or 11.5 to 13 inches for
slow pitch.

No part of the glove is allowed to be the same color as that of the
ball, including that of its seams. Pitchers are also not allowed to have
any white on their gloves including the seams. The umpire has discretion
to determine whether any coloring on the glove interferes with or
hinders the batter from seeing the ball clearly.
