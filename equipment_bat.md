The bat used by the batter can be made of wood, aluminum, or composite
materials such as carbon fiber. Sizes may vary but they may be no more
than long, in diameter, or in mass. The standard barrel diameter for
both slow pitch and fast pitch softball bats is 2 inches. Many
players prefer a smaller barrel, which reduces mass and allows higher
swing speed.

Although there are a variety of bats used, there are several that are
banned due to performance enhancement. For example, with a thinner wall,
the ball recoils faster off the bat, allowing it to travel further. Many
bats may be "doctored" or "juiced" by being end loaded, shaved, or
painted. End loading of a cap refers to the addition of weight manually
placed at the end of the barrel to distribute more weight at the tip.
Shaving bats require machine use in order to remove the inner walls of
the bat to improve elasticity. Lastly, illegal bats may be painted
to resemble legal ones.
