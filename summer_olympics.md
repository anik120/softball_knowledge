In the Women's Softball World Championships the
United States is the most dominant team, having won three of the past
four Olympic tournaments and the past seven World Championships. 
The current Junior Women's World Champion is the United States.

Women's softball debuted at the 1996 Summer Olympics and was removed from the
program following the 2008 Summer Olympics. Softball and Baseball
were unable to have their sport included in the program at the
2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2012 the heads of the
International Softball and Baseball Federations
announced their united effort to be included in the program in 2020.
"The proposal calls for men's baseball and women's softball to be played
at a single venue during 7 to 10 days. Each tournament would feature
eight teams. Baseball and softball would be two disciplines under a
single sports banner. The proposal awaits formal endorsement from the
congress of both federations. Other sports which sought to be included
in the 2020 program, when only one spot is up for filling, were: karate,
roller sports, squash, sports climbing, wakeboard and wushu. The IOC
executive board were to decide at their May meeting which sport to recommend for 
inclusion. The final decision was made in a vote of the full IOC in Buenos Aires in
September 2013. Softball and Baseball were re-included in the Summer
Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020, which was held in 2021. The American
team had entered the gold metal match with an undefeated record, facing
Japan. United States was defeated 2-0 by Japan, naming Japan the Tokyo
2020 Softball Olympic Gold Medalists.
