The batter attempts to swing the bat and hit the ball fair (into the field of play). After a
successful hit the batter becomes a base runner (or runner) and must run to first base. The 
defense attempts to field the ball and may throw the ball freely between players, so one player 
can field the ball while another moves to a position to put out the runner. The defense can tag 
the runner, by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base. 
The defense can also touch first base while in possession of the ball; in this case it is sufficient 
to beat the batter to first base and an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary. 
A runner is said to be "thrown out" when the play involves two or more defensive players. 
Runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base, but only one runner may occupy a base 
at any time and runners may not pass each other. When a ball is batted into play,
runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, 
a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play. 
In such a situation, the defense can throw to the base that the lead runner is attempting to 
take (a force out), and the defense can then also throw to the previous base. 
This can result in a multiple-out play: a double play is two outs, while a triple
play, a very rare occurrence, is three outs. Runners with an open base behind them 
are not forced to advance and do so at their own risk; the defense must tag such runners 
directly to put them out rather than tagging the base.

A ball hit in the air and caught before hitting the ground, in fair or
foul territory, puts the batter out. A fly ball is a ball hit high and
deep, a pop fly is a ball hit high but short, and
a line drive is a ball hit close to the
horizontal. After the catch, runners must return to their original
bases; if the defense throws the ball to that base before the runner
returns, the runner is out as well, resulting in a double play. A runner
who remains on the base until the ball is touched, or returns to the
base (tags up) after the catch, may try to advance
to the next base, at the risk of being tagged out between bases. As in
baseball, the infield fly rule applies in some game situations to prevent 
the defense from recording multiple force outs by deliberately dropping an easy catch.
