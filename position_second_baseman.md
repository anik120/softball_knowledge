The second baseman plays in between the
first baseman and second base itself, usually closer to second base. If
the ball is hit to the left side of the field, the second baseman covers
second base. If the ball is hit to right-field or center field, they
become the cut-off for the center fielder or the right fielder depending
who the ball was hit to. If the ball is hit to the first baseman, the
second baseman then is responsible for covering first. If the ball is
hit to the second baseman, they either throw the ball to second if there
was already a player on first, or they throw to first if there was
nobody on. If there is a runner on first and the person up to bat hits
the ball to the shortstop or the third baseman, the second baseman is in
charge of covering second to receive the throw from the shortstop or
third baseman. Then, depending where the runner is between home and
first, the second baseman makes the decision to throw the ball to first
or to hold the ball. Also, in the case of a bunt, the second baseman
must cover first as the first baseman runs to get the ball from the
bunt, then it is often thrown back to first base.
