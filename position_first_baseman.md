The first baseman is the position to the
left side of the diamond when facing home plate. The major role of the
first baseman is to receive throws from other defensive players in order
to get a force play at first base. Another role
they play is to make fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base.
The first baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs on the
field. Individuals at first base have quick hands and good reach, and
are always on the lookout to catch the player off base. They are also
generally taller and left-handed throwing,
which gives them an extended reach. First basemen however, can be both
left- and right-handed. Just like the catcher, first basemen may wear
specific first base mitts, usually having a longer
web allowing them to reach the taller throws over their head.
